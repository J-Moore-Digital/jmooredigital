Subject options:

- Noticed one conversion gap on your site

Email template:

Hi {{FirstName}},

I checked out {{BusinessName}} and noticed {{specific observation}}.

I build fast, conversion-focused websites for small businesses, and I can usually launch in 48 hours.

If helpful, I can send you a no-pressure 3-point homepage plan for {{BusinessName}} focused on getting more {{calls/bookings/leads}}.

Open to that?

{{CalendlyLink}}

## Channel 2: Instagram or Facebook DM

DM opener:

Hey {{FirstName}} - quick note after checking out {{BusinessName}}.  
You have a strong brand, and I spotted a quick website fix that could help increase {{calls/bookings}}.

Want me to send a 30-second Loom with 3 ideas?

If yes:

Perfect, I will send it over today.  
If you want to talk it through live, here is my 15-minute calendar: {{CalendlyLink}}

## Channel 3: Loom audit script (30-60 sec)

- Intro: "I made this quick audit for {{BusinessName}}."
- Problem: "Your site is clean, but the first screen does not make the next step obvious."
- Fix 1: stronger headline with location + service.
- Fix 2: one clear CTA button above the fold.
- Fix 3: proof block (reviews/results) under hero.
- Close: "If you want, I can build this in your current style and launch fast. Book here: {{CalendlyLink}}."

## Objection handling snippets

"We already have a website."

- Totally fair. Most of my work is improving conversion, not just design. I can show 3 no-cost fixes first.

"We don't have budget right now."

- Understood. I can start with a lean page that covers the essentials and you can expand later.

"Send pricing."

- Absolutely. Packages start at $500, with custom options based on pages and features.
